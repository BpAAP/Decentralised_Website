# Fully decentralised website system.

## Development will continue on a fork.

## Aim:
Develop a framework for deploying entirely decentralised websites
on IPFS while fixind some of the usual issues with this sort of setup:
1. Provide a user-memorable way of navigating to the site, namely through EDS using Ethereum based resolution. Providing a way for both Web 2.0 and 3.0 users to reach the site.
2. (An extension to point 1) Provide a mechanism for updating the content of the website and directing users to the most up-to-date version.
3. Fix distribution issue with IPFS data being purged from the network. Use In-browser js-ipfs node to access data faster and to host it for others. With enough round the clock users this should make distribution easy. Only one 'data introduction' node would be required to pin content. (Perhaps only initially).
