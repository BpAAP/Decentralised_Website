## Web 2.0 Entry

This is the site where web 2.0 approaches should be directed so that they can be appropriately directed to the most recent version of the website.

This will accomplish:
1. Receive web 2.0 approach from x.eth.link, through any HTTPS enabled public gateway.
2. Load 3rd party resources from IPFS, (those in the packages folder).
3. Start own gateway in Service Worker, to remove 3rd party public gateway from exchange.
4. Check a.x.eth and b.x.eth domains for most recent major release. (This functionality is postponed for now due to gas prices) 
5. Show site in iframe
6. Keep looking for more up-to-date version through ipns, prompt user when a newer version is available.
