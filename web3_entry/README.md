## Web 3.0 Entry

This is the site where web 3.0 approaches should be directed so that they can be appropriately directed to the most recent version of the website.

This will accomplish:
1. Receive web 3.0 approach from x.eth.link, through any web 3.0 capable browser.
2. Check a.x.eth and b.x.eth domains for most recent major release. (This functionality is postponed for now due to gas prices)
3. Show site in iframe
4. Keep looking for more up-to-date version through ipns, prompt user when a newer version is available.
