## Packages folder

In order to be fully decentralised all the 3rd party resources should also be available on ipfs. These should be updated when possible to keep up with security patches.

I made none of these, they are just local copies of the files available from CDNs.

The packages used are:

1. Bootstrap CSS   | v4.5.0  | bootstrap.min.css | https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css
2. JQuery          | v3.5.1  | jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js | https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js
3. Popper          | v1.16.0 | popper.min.js | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js
4. Bootstrap JS    | v4.5.0  | bootstrap.min.js | https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js
5. js-ipfs         | ?       | js-ipfs-core.min.js | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ipfs/dist/index.min.js

These should be hosted on IPFS independently of the website so that they remain at a constant address.
